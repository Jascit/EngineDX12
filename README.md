This project is a game engine built on top of DX12 (DirectX 12), developed with modern performance and efficiency requirements in mind. The main goal is to create a flexible and scalable platform for game development (based on Windows), which includes several key subsystems and systems.

### Key components:

#### Core Systems:
- **Game Engine**: Manages the game logic and interactions between other systems.
- **Rendering System**: Responsible for rendering graphics, lighting, and textures.
- **Physics System**: Calculates physical interactions in the game world.
- **Audio System**: Handles sound effects and music.
- **Input System**: Processes input from the keyboard, mouse, gamepads.
- **AI System**: Implements artificial intelligence for NPCs.
- **Memory Management System**: Manages memory usage efficiently.

#### Subsystems:
- **Event System**: Handles events and messaging between systems.
- **Garbage Collection**: Ensures automatic freeing of unused memory.
- **Scripting System**: Allows integration of scripts to modify the game's behavior.
- **Time and Ticking System**: Manages time calculations and step-by-step game updates.
- **Scene Management System**: Manages scenes and transitions between them.
- **Animation System**: Handles animations for objects and characters.
- **Entity-Component-System (ECS)**: Architecture for organizing game objects and components.
- **Threading System**: Parallel processing of tasks to improve performance.
- **Resource Management System**: Manages resources like textures, models, and shaders.
- **Networking System**: For implementing network features and multiplayer gameplay.

The project is still under development, where most systems are not yet written and are only planned, while others are being structured into a global system and undergoing refactoring or are in the process of development and coding.
